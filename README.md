## Project Workflow

1. **Decompose Tasks into Subtasks**
   - Break down each task into manageable subtasks to ensure clarity and focus.
2. **Task Distribution**

   - Assign subtasks to team members based on their expertise and availability.

3. **Communication and Collaboration**

   - Maintain open lines of communication. Regularly discuss progress, ask questions, and inform the team about any problems or successes.

4. **Completion of a Task**
   1. **Synchronize with Develop Branch**
      - Before considering a task complete, pull the latest changes from the develop branch (`develop`) into your task branch to ensure it is up to date.
   2. **Local Merge**
      - Perform a local merge to integrate the latest changes and resolve any conflicts.
   3. **Functionality Check**
      - Verify that the functionality of your task works as expected. Perform thorough testing.
   4. **Create a Merge Request (MR)**
      - Create a Merge Request (MR) in GitLab, ensuring that it does not have any conflicts with the main branch.
   5. **MR Description**
      - Fill out the MR template, detailing the content and purpose of the task in the appropriate section.
   6. **Code Review**
      - Assign 1-2 team members to review the MR. Code should not be merged without their approval, except in emergencies, which must be discussed and approved in the team chat.
   7. **Merge Process**
      - Upon approval, merge the feature branch into the `develop` branch using the "Squash and merge" option to maintain a clean commit history.
   8. **Cleanup**
      - Delete the feature branch after the merge to keep the repository tidy and organized.

## Project structure

### GIT:

- The **main** branch - for deploy
- The **develop** branch is a working branch, from which we create branches to perform tasks
- Feature branches are called like **number/task-name**
- Other branches in the same style - **number/issue-name** (doc, refactor etc.)

Commit names - follow [commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) e.g. `feat: add submit button`

### Structure

Stick to [one of the recommendations from Next](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation) - we use the app folder only for pages, layout and routing (page styles, etc.). etc. are included there too).
We place components and other logical entities in scr in the appropriate directories (for example components, etc.)

- Next suggests writing file names in **kebab-case**, with a small letter
- Component file names are capitalized in **UpperCamelCase**
- Hook file names are **lowerCamelCase** (useSomteehing.tsx)

In the component folder, use index.ts, in which we do the re-export.

### TS

- class / interface / type / enum / decorator / type parameter - **UpperCamelCase**
- variable / parameter / function / method / property / module aliases - **lowerCamelCase**
- global constants, including enum element names - **CONSTANT_CASE**

Describe props types directly in the component file, general types are placed in the constants directory.
